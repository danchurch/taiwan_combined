The nice thing about using the usearch merging algorithms is that they use a bayesian approach to calculating the q-scores of paired reads, so that agreements on base calls between R1 and R2 improve Q scores, and disagreements reduce them. The reduction by disagreement is proportional to the confidence of the two base calls at a site, so if the disagreement occurs at the end of a read, where quality is lower, the higher (more reliable) Q has a much greater influence on the final q-score of a base call.
