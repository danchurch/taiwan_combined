## start over, see if we can redo our original biom table construction. 


## we already rearranged the split barcodes on the leaf reads, is that 
## still laying around?

## they're here:

ls -lh /home/daniel/Documents/taiwan/taiwan_dada2/rearranged_leafR1.fastq
ls -lh /home/daniel/Documents/taiwan/taiwan_dada2/rearranged_leafR2.fastq

## let's make a link to these:



ln -s /home/daniel/Documents/taiwan/taiwan_dada2/rearranged_leafR1.fastq reLeafR1.fastq
ln -s /home/daniel/Documents/taiwan/taiwan_dada2/rearranged_leafR2.fastq reLeafR2.fastq

rm reLeafR*.fastq

## confused - it looks like I used to have an aggregate wood reads file, 
## all the R1s in one file, R2s in the other. 

## whatever it was, I don't have it anymore. 

## without this, do we just loop through the wood reads, trim as we go?

## wood directory

wooddir='/home/daniel/Documents/taiwan/woodreads/'

i='lane1-s257-index-GAGGACTT-CCTAAGTCNNNN-PosI_S257_L001_R1_001.fastq'

cut <(echo $i) -d "-" -f 1

echo $i 

for i in $wooddir*"_R1_"*; do 
    echo $i
done

fastx_trimmer -l 255 -i $i -o woodR1_trimmed.fastq
fastx_trimmer -l 210 -i woodR2.fastq -o woodR2_trimmed.fastq
